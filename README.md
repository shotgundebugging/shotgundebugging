# 👋 Hi, I'm Mircea

**Software Engineer & Small Town Entrepreneur**  
Ruby and Bash enthusiast • Big data explorer • Former Buddhist monk

## 🚀 About Me

I love building resilient systems and exploring the intersections of entrepreneurship and technology. My toolkit is lean but powerful: mainly Ruby and Bash, with a true appreciation for the elegance of simple, robust solutions.

While AI grabs the headlines, I've been diving into recent discoveries in big data (where meaningful insights often come from the unglamorous work of wrangling information at scale).
